Intro
-----
Donu is a free open source project derived from Donu (which is derived from Bitcoin), with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.



Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run donu-qt.exe.

Donu Core is the original Donu client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Donu transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
