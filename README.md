## The Donu Core Wallet

The Donu Core wallet gives people the ability to send, receive and stake DONU as well as run masternodes on the Donu blockchain.  It also allows users of [The Donito Platform](https://www.doni.to) to enjoy benefits such as reduced platform fees, and other applicable discounts and future rewards.  Additional wallets such as light wallets, mobile and other implementations will be made available as well with the end goal being to completely decentralize the Donu platform.

## About Donito and Donu

Donito (pronounced: dough-knee-toe) is dervied from an Esperanto word meaning "to give", which is the central theme for the project. The ultimate goal of Donito is to facilitate an easy way for creators/charities/workers to accept a large selection of cryptocurrencies from patrons.  Donito also has a buy-back program, in which all fees generated by the platform are used to buy DONU from the open market, which are optionally burned in an effort to prevent over-supply.

You can learn more about Donito by visiting [The Donito Platform Website](https://www.doni.to) or [The Donu Crypto Website](https://www.donu.io).

## History behind Donu and the team

Before it was "Donu", there was Neos.  Neos was a project created back in 2014 with the intention of bringing a unique product with quality support and innovation into the industry.  Once hearing about the issues people were having with Patreon and the over-policing of social media, we started looking into this sector to learn more and see what gaps could be filled.  Discovering the incredibly large fees charged by most services and solutions alongside the lack of unbias to service members we decided to build Donu.
